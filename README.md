# Weighted A* Search for the 15 Puzzle Problem

To run the source code, make sure that all files (main.py, priorityQueue.py, weightedAStar.py) are within the same directory. Open the console/terminal, and change directories to the one containing the files.

Python must be installed on your computer in order to run the main.py file. The program runs on 3.11.0, but any version of Python should run the code.

Run the following command in the terminal:

python3 main.py

(if using Python ver. older than 3.0, remove the 3 from this command)

You will be prompted to enter an input file name. Enter Input#.py, # being the number of the input file. Output#.py will be generated.
